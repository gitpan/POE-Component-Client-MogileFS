POE-Component-Client-MogileFS

This is a POE Client for using MogileFS.  It's based on 
POE::Component::Wheel::Run (I stole large chunks of it directly from the
cookbook) and should allow you to use most of the MogileFS::Client api in
a non blocking fashion from POE.  You should probably read the MogileFS::Client
as well as these if you plan to use it.
